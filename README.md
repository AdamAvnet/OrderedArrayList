# OrderedArrayList

Discussion Summary: Do we have to import ArrayList? Yes
		You need parentheses after creating the generic variable. 
		Don't copy all of the SuperArray code, you can use the ArrayList code by default with super.method
		No instance variables needed. Just use what the ArrayList provides. For rewriting methods check for
		nulls and then call the ArrayList method. For the constructors don't include T in the title. Maybe 
		we can use "super()"? We can use == for comparing to null.
